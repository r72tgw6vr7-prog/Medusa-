# Deployment Preparation Complete - Gallery & UI Fixes

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Deployment

---

## 🎯 Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Gallery Page Title Fixed
**Issue**: Gallery page showed "0.4 gallery" (template sketch name) instead of proper styled title

**Solution**:
- Updated `/src/pages/GalleryPage.tsx` to use proper Playfair Display font
- Matched styling with other page titles:
  - Font: `font-playfair`
  - Size: `text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl`
  - Color: `text-[#D4AF37]` (brand gold)
  - Spacing: `mb-8` for proper separation

**Result**: Gallery page now has professional, consistent title styling

---

### 2. ✅ Studio Carousel Homepage Fix
**Issue**: Carousel showing only ceiling in photos with wrong positioning and full viewport height

**Solution** (`/src/components/organisms/StudioCarousel.tsx`):
- Changed desktop height from `lg:h-[600px]` to `lg:h-[66.67vh]` (2/3 viewport)
- Changed `object-cover` to `object-contain` (shows full photo context)
- Changed `objectPosition: 'center bottom'` to `'center center'` (proper alignment)
- Mobile/tablet heights remain fixed: 400px and 500px respectively

**Result**: 
- Desktop: 2/3 screen height as requested
- No more ceiling-only views
- Full studio context visible
- Proper vertical and horizontal centering

---

### 3. ✅ Gallery Photos Organized & Uploaded
**Massive Photo Organization**: 506 high-resolution photos processed and organized

#### Photo Distribution:
```
Gallery (Tattoos):
├── Debi:    78 files  → /public/images/gallery/debi/
├── Loui:    179 files → /public/images/gallery/loui/
├── Luz:     19 files  → /public/images/gallery/luz/
└── Legacy:  148 files → /public/images/gallery/legacy/

Other Content:
├── Piercings: 20 files → /public/images/piercings/
├── Studio:    56 files → /public/images/studio/
└── Partners:  6 files  → /public/images/partners/

TOTAL: 506 Photos
```

#### Organization Script:
- Created: `/scripts/organize-gallery-photos.sh`
- Maintains high resolution (no compression)
- Automatic HEIC to JPEG conversion (10 files converted)
- Preserves original filenames and metadata
- Organized by artist and category

#### File Structure:
```
public/
└── images/
    ├── gallery/
    │   ├── debi/      (Debi's Old School, Maori, Blackwork, etc.)
    │   ├── loui/      (Loui's Linework, Realism, etc.)
    │   ├── luz/       (Eli Luquez's Realism work)
    │   └── legacy/    (Historical/Legacy tattoos)
    ├── piercings/     (Medusa piercing photos)
    ├── studio/        (Interior studio shots)
    └── partners/      (Partner service photos)
        ├── i-am-robot/
        └── we-piercing/
```

## 📋 Remaining Task: Photo Cleanup for Deployment

### Essential Photos to KEEP:
1. **Gallery Photos**: All 424 tattoo photos (organized by artist)
2. **Artist Portraits**: Photos used in team/artist sections
3. **Studio Photos**: Interior shots for carousel and about section
4. **Piercing Gallery**: 20 piercing photos
5. **Graphics**: Any design elements, logos, icons used on site
6. **News Content**: Any images related to news/blog posts

### Photos to REMOVE:
- Unused test images
- Duplicate files
- Old backup images
- Placeholder images not used in production
- Development/testing photos

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Audit current `/public/images` directory
2. Cross-reference with actual usage in components
3. Create backup before deletion
4. Remove unused files
5. Test all pages to ensure no broken images

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Organization Script Usage:
```bash
# If you need to reorganize or add more photos in future:
./scripts/organize-gallery-photos.sh
```

### Photo Guidelines for Future:
- Keep high resolution (min 1920px width for main gallery)
- Use JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics
- Organize by artist in `/public/Photos/` before running script
- Run organization script to auto-copy to correct locations
