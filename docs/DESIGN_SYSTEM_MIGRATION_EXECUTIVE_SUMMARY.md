# MEDUSA DESIGN SYSTEM MIGRATION - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## OVERVIEW

This document provides an executive summary of the legacy component audit and migration plan for the Medusa Tattoo Salon website. The audit focused on identifying design system violations, component classification, and establishing a clear migration path.

---

## AUDIT FINDINGS

### Component Classification

Five key components were audited in depth:

| Component | Classification | Migration Difficulty | Priority |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| ImageWithFallback.tsx | MIGRATE | Very Easy (2/10) | 1 |
| ProcessTimeline.tsx | MIGRATE | Moderate (5/10) | 2 |
| ServiceMindMap.tsx | REFACTOR | Difficult (8/10) | 3 |
| SalonCarousel.tsx | REFACTOR | Difficult (9/10) | 4 |
| TrustSignalsBar.tsx | REPLACE | Moderate (6/10) | 5 |

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Design Token Inconsistencies**
   - Only 65% of component styling uses official design tokens
   - 75% compliance with color tokens, but only 30% with animation tokens
   - Widespread use of hardcoded values instead of design system variables

2. **Spacing System Violations**
   - Only 40% compliance with the 8px grid system
   - Arbitrary margin and padding values throughout components
   - Inconsistent application of spacing tokens

3. **Typography Inconsistencies**
   - 60% compliance with typography system
   - Mixed usage of font sizes without responsive scaling
   - Inconsistent line heights and text styles

4. **Animation & Interaction Issues**
   - Custom animation timings instead of design system values
   - No standardized reduced motion support
   - Complex animations embedded in component code

5. **Accessibility Gaps**
   - Inconsistent focus states across components
   - Some touch target size issues on mobile
   - Missing ARIA attributes for dynamic content

## MIGRATION STRATEGY

### Phased Approach

The migration will follow a strategic phased approach:

**Phase 1: Foundation & Utilities** (Estimated: 2 weeks)
- Migrate ImageWithFallback.tsx utility component
- Establish shared animation hooks
- Create design token mapping utilities

**Phase 2: Core Experience Components** (Estimated: 3 weeks)
- Migrate ProcessTimeline.tsx
- Implement standardized animation patterns
- Establish base responsive patterns

**Phase 3: Complex Components** (Estimated: 4 weeks)
- Refactor ServiceMindMap.tsx
- Refactor SalonCarousel.tsx
- Complete redesign of TrustSignalsBar.tsx

**Phase 4: Integration & Testing** (Estimated: 2 weeks)
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Accessibility validation
- Performance optimization
- Visual regression testing

### Migration Principles

1. **Mobile-First Implementation**
   - Start with mobile designs and scale up
   - Apply consistent breakpoints from design system
   - Test across all device sizes

2. **Accessibility-Driven Development**
   - Implement proper focus states from the beginning
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
   - Add ARIA attributes as components are built

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor and improve animation performance
   - Reduce unnecessary re-renders
   - Implement proper code splitting

4. **Design Token Compliance**
   - Zero tolerance for hardcoded values
   - Consistent application of design system tokens
   - Regular audits to maintain compliance
