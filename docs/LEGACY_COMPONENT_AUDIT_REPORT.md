# LEGACY COMPONENT AUDIT REPORT

## OVERVIEW

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the legacy components in the Medusa Tattoo Salon project. The audit is focused on identifying design system violations, component classification, and providing recommendations for migration.

---

## METHODOLOGY

Components were analyzed according to the following criteria:

1. **Design System Compliance**: Adherence to the Medusa design tokens and specifications
2. **Code Structure Quality**: Organization, readability, and maintainability
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance features
4. **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach and breakpoint handling
5. **Performance**: Efficiency considerations and optimization opportunities

Based on this analysis, each component is classified into one of the following categories:

- **MIGRATE**: Component follows design system closely, needs minimal changes
- **REFACTOR**: Component has structural issues but valuable functionality to keep
- **REPLACE**: Component should be rebuilt using modern design system components
- **DELETE**: Component is redundant or unused and should be removed

## COMPONENT ANALYSIS

### 1. ServiceMindMap.tsx

**Classification**: REFACTOR

**Design System Violations**:
- ❌ Uses hardcoded px values for shadows instead of design token variables (`shadow-gold-glow-strong` vs. token vars)
- ❌ Uses non-standardized spacing values like `mb-6` instead of spacing tokens
- ❌ Contains custom CSS classes for border effects outside the design system
- ❌ Uses inconsistent text sizes (`text-headline-xl`, `text-headline-lg`, etc.) without consistent mobile-first approach
- ❌ Hardcoded rgba colors like `rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.3)` instead of using design system variables

**Code Structure Issues**:
- ❌ Mixes styling concerns with component logic
- ❌ Heavy reliance on inline styles instead of utility classes
- ❌ Inconsistent naming conventions for style classes

**Code Structure Issues**:
- ✅ Clean functional component with single responsibility
- ✅ Good error handling pattern
- ✅ Proper TypeScript typing with React.ImgHTMLAttributes
- ✅ Effective props forwarding pattern

**Accessibility Issues**:

   - High impact across the application

2. **ProcessTimeline.tsx** (MIGRATE)
   - Already closely follows design system
   - Well-structured component
   - Moderate changes needed

3. **ServiceMindMap.tsx** (REFACTOR)
   - Core business functionality
   - Requires significant styling updates
   - Important customer-facing component

## CONCLUSION

The legacy components exhibit inconsistent adherence to the design system, with particular issues in spacing, animations, and color usage. While some components like ImageWithFallback and ProcessTimeline are relatively close to compliance, others like TrustSignalsBar require complete rebuilds.

The recommended migration strategy prioritizes components that are closest to compliance and have the highest impact across the application. By following a systematic approach to migration, the project can achieve design system consistency while preserving the valuable functionality of these components.
