# üöÄ URGENT: 1-Minute Deployment Checklist

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Target**: Production Deployment NOW

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Just Now):
1. **Gallery Title** - Upgraded to large, bold, professional styling
2. **Studio Carousel** - Fixed to 2/3 screen height with proper positioning  
3. **506 Photos** - Organized and uploaded to `/public/images/`

---

## ‚ö° DEPLOY NOW - Required Steps:

### 1. Build Production Bundle (30 seconds)
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Test Build Locally (10 seconds)
```bash
npm run preview
```
- Open browser to `http://localhost:4173`
- Quick check: Gallery page loads, Studio carousel works

### 3. Deploy (20 seconds)
```bash
# If using Vercel:
vercel --prod

# OR if using Netlify:
netlify deploy --prod

# OR if using other:
git add .
git commit -m "Production ready: Gallery fixes + 506 photos"
git push origin main
```

---

## üî• CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED:
- ‚úÖ Gallery title now **bold, large, professional** (5xl ‚Üí 7xl)
- ‚úÖ Studio carousel **2/3 viewport** on desktop
- ‚úÖ **No more ceiling photos** - full context visible
- ‚úÖ **506 high-res photos** ready

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ITEMS (Non-blocking):
- Some HEIC files converted to JPEG (already done)
- Partner photos directory creation error (non-critical)
- Lint warnings for duplicate classes (cosmetic, won't break)

---

## üìä Performance Notes:
- **506 photos** = large payload
- **Recommendation**: Enable lazy loading (already in code)
- **Recommendation**: CDN caching if available
- First load might be slower, but all subsequent loads cached

---

## üéØ What Changed Since Last Version:
**Files Modified**:
1. `src/pages/GalleryPage.tsx` - Title styling improved
2. `src/components/organisms/StudioCarousel.tsx` - Height & positioning fixed
3. `public/images/` - 506 photos added in organized structure

**No Breaking Changes** - Safe to deploy

---

## üö® IF BUILD FAILS:
Check these:
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
rm -rf dist
npm run build
```

---

## ‚úÖ POST-DEPLOYMENT CHECK (Optional - 1 min):
1. Visit `/gallery` - Title looks professional?
2. Visit `/` (homepage) - Studio carousel 2/3 height?
3. Click through gallery images - All loading?

**If yes to all 3**: ‚úÖ **DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS**

---

## üéâ YOU'RE READY!
Run these commands NOW:
```bash
npm run build && npm run preview
# Check it looks good, then:
vercel --prod  # or your deployment command
```

**Estimated time**: 1 minute total
